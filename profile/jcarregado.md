<h2>Thesis Title</h2>
<p>Static and Dynamic Characterization of Joined Wing Sensorcraft</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The scope of the work is to deliver to Boieng a complete set of static and dynamic characterizations of the 3m JWSC, providing understanding of the aero-elastic response of a highly non-linear geometry – the joined wing configuration. Ground vibration testing is planned and conducted to dynamically characterize the aircraft. Finite Element models are validated and iteratively updated using both static and dynamic experimental results.</p>
