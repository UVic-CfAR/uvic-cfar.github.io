<h2>Thesis Title</h2>
<p>Static Characterization of a composite 4m wing for shape sensing</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The scope of the work is to deliver adequate static data to the Boeing Company of a composite wing using fiber optic bragg gratings (FBG) as an input of shape equations to calculate the wing’s bending deformation. Furthermore, a secondary shape monitoring system will be developed using photogrammetric approach and it will be used as test’s validation. Both ground and flight testing will be conducted in CfAR.</p>
