## Thesis Title

Static Characterization of a composite 4m wing for shape sensing

## Abstract

The scope of the work is to deliver adequate static data to the Boeing Company of a composite wing using fiber optic bragg gratings (FBG) as an input of shape equations to calculate the wing’s bending deformation. Furthermore, a secondary shape monitoring system will be developed using photogrammetric approach and it will be used as test’s validation. Both ground and flight testing will be conducted in CfAR.
