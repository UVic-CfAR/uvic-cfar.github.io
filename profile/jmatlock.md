<p>A Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Performance Evaluation of a UAV Hybrid Propulsion System GARDN, MITACS, Bombardier</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This research focuses on the future of aviation technology, and transitioning to cleaner, more efficient and quieter Unmanned Air Systems using Hybrid Propulsion Systems.  Hybrid systems offer several potential benefits over more conventional gas and electric systems including smaller environmental impacts, reduced fuel consumption, longer endurance, redundant and novel configurations through distributed propulsion.</p>
