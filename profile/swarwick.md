# Staff: Stephen Warwick

## Job Description

Instrumentation and Simulation Engineer

## Summary of Responsibilities

Stephen is responsible for developing instrumentation designs to measure and validate systems developed at the centre for aerospace research. From the measurement and validation work, analytical and numerical models are updated and fit as required. Past experiences include the design, application, validation, and operation of a variety of distributed sensors including strain using conventional foil gauges, design of an Electronic Flight Data Recorder, and Optical Pressure sensing.

## Graduate Thesis 

### Title

In Flight Displacement Measurement of a High Aspect-Ratio Aero-Elastic Wing Using Strain Pattern Analysis

### Abstract

In the pursuit for increased efficiency in tomorrow’s aerial vehicles, to benefit the environment, new increasingly aero-elastic structures are being explored in using multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO). These design studies need validation and in some cases may even require active structural monitoring. An unmanned atmospheric test aerial vehicle with highly elastic wings was made and equipped with strain gauges optimally located for application of the strain pattern analysis method to actively estimate the displacement of the wings in flight. The SPA method was evaluated to determine tolerance of measurements validate on the ground.
