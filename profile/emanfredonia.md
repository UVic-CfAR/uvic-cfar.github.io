## Thesis Title

Energy Harvesting

## Abstract

The scope of the work is to propose and model an energy harvesting system in order to analyze the trade off between gains, system weight, cost and complexity. What is needed is a system level model of a flexible aircraft with which an energy harvesting concept can be implemented and its overall benefit evaluated using Multi-Disciplinary Optimization techniques.
