<h1>About</h1>
<h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
<p>The University of Victoria Center for Aerospace Research has been leading research into unmanned vehicles and their application since 2012. The center's mandate is to promote the use of unmanned air vehicles in commercial applications that were previously impossible or prohibitively expensive using manned aircraft and helicopters. The future of aviation is unmanned and UVic CfAR can help you get your idea off the ground!</p>
